## Overview

This is a frontend application built with Angular 19 for an interactive IQ test platform. Users can browse available tests, take them question by question, and receive detailed results including scores, performance by category (e.g., Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, Memory, Mathematical Ability), and personalized recommendations. The platform categorizes questions by type to highlight users' strengths. It includes user authentication via Google or standard login, role-based access (e.g., admin privileges), and an admin dashboard for managing tests, questions, valid score ranges, question classifications, and viewing aggregated user results with filters and basic CRUD operations.

The backend for this project is hosted in a separate repository: [Link to Backend Repo](https://github.com/yourusername/backend-repo) (replace with actual link).

## Features

- **User Dashboard**:
  - View available tests on the homepage.
  - Select and take a test, progressing through questions one by one.
  - Receive results with:
    - Number of correct answers (e.g., 35/50).
    - Overall performance level (e.g., "Above Average" or "Superior al Término Medio").
    - Test duration and completion stats (e.g., 36 min 4 sec, 50/50 questions completed).
    - Breakdown by category (e.g., Logical Reasoning: 77.78%, Verbal Reasoning: 50%, Memory: 100%, Mathematical Ability: 50%).
    - Interpretation of score with insights (e.g., strong mental abilities, quick learning, creativity, and logical reasoning).
    - Recommendations for development (e.g., engage in strategic games, advanced courses, or leadership projects).
  - View personal test history and results.

- **Admin Dashboard** (Role-Based Access):
  - Manage tests: Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) tests.
  - Manage questions per test: Add/edit questions with classifications (e.g., logic, math, verbal, memory).
  - Define valid score ranges for result interpretations.
  - View aggregated results from all users, with column filters for analysis.
  - User management: Manage users, assign roles (e.g., admin, user).

- **Security and Authentication**:
  - Authentication options: Google OAuth or email/password.
  - Role-based authorization for protected routes (e.g., admin sections).
  - Global exception handling for robust error management.

- **Technical Highlights**:
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
  - Routing with lazy loading for performance optimization.
  - State management (e.g., via NgRx or services).
  - Integration with backend APIs for data persistence.

## Technologies Used

- Angular 19
- TypeScript
- HTML5/CSS3 (with possible libraries like Bootstrap or Angular Material for UI)
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Angular Router for navigation
- Angular HttpClient for API calls
- Authentication libraries (e.g., AngularFire for Google auth, or custom JWT handling)
- Global error handling with HTTP interceptors
- Reactive and/or template-driven forms

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Angular CLI (v19)
- Access to the backend API (running locally or deployed)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Taday97/ExamiNation.git
   cd iq-test-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   - Update `src/environments/environment.ts` with the backend API URL and authentication keys (e.g., Google Client ID).

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

5. For production build:
   ```bash
   ng build --prod
   ```

## Usage

- **As a User**:
  1. Sign up or log in via Google or email/password.
  2. Browse available tests on the homepage.
  3. Select a test (e.g., Test Otis Básico).
  4. Answer 50 questions across categories like logic, verbal, memory, and math.
  5. View detailed results with score, category breakdown, insights, and recommendations.
  6. Access test history to review past performance.

- **As an Admin**:
  1. Log in with admin credentials.
  2. Access admin routes to manage tests, questions, and users.
  3. View and filter global user results for analysis.

**Note**: Results are based on test performance and are illustrative; they do not represent formal IQ scores.

### Instructions for Use

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the entire Markdown content above into your `README.md` file in your GitHub repository.

2. **Update Placeholders**:
   - Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/iq-test-platform.git` with your actual repository URL.
   - Replace `[Link to Backend Repo](https://github.com/yourusername/backend-repo)` with the actual URL of your backend repository.
   - Update the screenshot paths (e.g., `screenshots/homepage.png`) to match the actual file paths in your repository. Create a `screenshots` folder in your repo, upload your images there, and ensure the file names match the references in the README.

3. **Add Screenshots**:
   - Upload your project screenshots to a `screenshots` folder in your GitHub repository.
   - Ensure the file names match those referenced in the README (e.g., `homepage.png`, `question.png`, etc.).
   - If your screenshots have different names, update the paths in the `Screenshots` section accordingly.

4. **Optional Customizations**:
   - If you use specific libraries (e.g., Angular Material, NgRx), you can add them to the `Technologies Used` section for clarity.
   - If you want to add more sections (e.g., "Project Structure" or "API Endpoints"), let me know, and I can help expand the README.
   - If you have a deployed version of the app, you can add a "Live Demo" section with a link.

5. **Save and Commit**:
   - Save the `README.md` file in your project’s root directory.
